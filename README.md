# 👋 Hi, I'm Nguyen Hong Nhat Linh

## 🚀 AI & Machine Learning Engineer | Computer Vision & Data Science
**Bridging AI Research and Industrial Production with Real-world Data**

I am an AI Engineer specializing in Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Large Language Model (LLM) systems, with a strong focus on real-world deployment.
My work centers on building models that remain reliable under noisy data, class imbalance, latency constraints, and hardware limitations commonly encountered in production environments.
